  Characteristics: Staphylococcus is a very significant organism because of its ability
    to cause a number of diseases and infections in human and animals. It causes
    localized supportive lesions and abscesses on skin, or deep-seated infections
    like osteomyelitis, endocarditis, or more serious skin infections like furunculosis.
    Because of their ability to develop resistance to many antibiotics, Staphylococcus
    aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis form a major group of nosocomial pathogens
    infecting surgical wounds and causing infections associated with indwelling medical
    devices.
  Symptoms:
  - 'Abscesses and boils: These painful sores form under your skin, causing redness
    and pain.'
  - 'Cellulitis: This type of infection causes swollen, red, painful skin and tissue
    just under your skin.'
  trivia_1: "The name Staphylococcus originates from Greek terms (staphyle and kokkos)
    which literally translate as\r\na bunch of grapes. Over 30 types of Staphylococci
    bacteria cause infections in humans (typically skin\r\ninfections which are limited
    to a small area of an individual\u2019s skin, such as \u2013 boils, folliculitis,
    cellulitis, and\r\nimpetigo), however, the most common type of Staph infection
    is caused by S. aureus."
  trivia_2: There were an estimated 5 million people in the United States colonized
    by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains.
  trivia_3: According to a report published in the Journal of the American Medical
    Association, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was responsible for
    over 19,000 deaths and 95,000 life-threatening infections in 2005.
