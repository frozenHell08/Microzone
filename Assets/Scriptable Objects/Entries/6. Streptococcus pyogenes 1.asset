  Characteristics: The Streptococcus pyogenes isolates had high resistance rates
    against macrolides and tetracycline. They mainly expressed the ermB gene type
    and cMLSB phenotype. Their common emm types are emm1.0 and emm12.0, which have
    different frequencies of speA and speC.
  Symptoms:
  - a sore, red throat with thick pus-like fluid around the tonsils
  - enlarged and tender lymph nodes in and around the neck
  trivia_1: "If your child has congestion, coughing, a runny nose, watery eyes and/or
    diarrhea, she most likely doesn\u2019t have strep. Chances are it\u2019s just
    a cold or some allergies \u2013 and postnasal snot drip is the most common cause
    of sore throats in my office."
  trivia_2: "Sometimes, strep comes with a rash. We then call it \u201CScarlet Fever\u201D
    and it is no more dangerous than just plain strep throat. Someone just gave it
    a cool name and then we get to feel like we are living in that computer game
    \u201COregon Trail.\u201D"
  trivia_3: When a child has a sore throat, in general, there is a 37 percent chance
    that it is strep (Group A Strep, aka, Streptococcus pyogenes)
