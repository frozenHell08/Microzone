  m_Name: 16Human polyomavirus 2
  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  Kingdom: Virus
  Phylum: Cossaviricota
  Class: Papovaviricetes
  Order: Sepolyvirales
  Family: Polyomaviridae
  Genus: Betapolyomavirus
  Species: Human polyomavirus 2
  Characteristics: 'The three most well-known polyomaviruses are BK virus, JC virus,
    and SV40 virus. Polyomaviruses are DNA viruses. '
  Symptoms:
  - ' In healthy people, the BK virus causes a mild, self-limiting upper respiratory
    infection (mostly in childhood). '
  trivia_1: Small, unenveloped DNA viruses known as polyomaviruses are common in
    nature. After primary infection, the viruses remain dormant in immunocompetent
    hosts. With few exceptions, infections brought on by these viruses develop when
    the immune system is weakened, particularly when T cell insufficiency is present.
  trivia_2: Since JCV and BKV are viruses that are often found in people, the data
    suggest that eating or drinking contaminated food or water may be a possible
    entry point for these viruses or polyomavirus DNA into the general population.
  trivia_3: Serological evidence of previous BK infection is present in about 80%
    of the adult population.
