  Characteristics: Bilharzia, another name for schistosomiasis, is a condition brought
    on by parasitic worms.
  Symptoms:
  - Children who contract the infection repeatedly may experience anemia, malnutrition,
    and learning challenges. The parasite can harm the liver, gut, lungs, and bladder
    after years of infection.
  trivia_1: Schistosomiasis symptoms are brought on by the body's response to the
    eggs, not by the worms themselves. Adult worms can lay eggs that don't leave
    the body and can get stuck in the colon or bladder, where they can cause inflammation
    or scarring.
  trivia_2: With infrequent reports in the Arabian Peninsula, Schistosoma mansoni
    is mostly found in sub-Saharan Africa, a few South American nations (Brazil,
    Venezuela, Suriname), and the Caribbean. S. Africa and isolated regions of the
    Middle East are home to haematobium.
  trivia_3: Rarely, eggs can induce convulsions, paralysis, or inflammation of the
    spinal cord when they are detected in the brain or spinal cord.
