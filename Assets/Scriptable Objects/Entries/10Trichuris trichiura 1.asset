  Kingdom: Animal
  Phylum: Nematoda
  Class: Enoplea
  Order: Trichinellida
  Family: Trichuridae
  Genus: Trichuris
  Species: Trichuris trichiura
  Characteristics: The Trichuris trichiura infects people either ingest eggs after
    coming into contact with contaminated soil or eat items contaminated with soil
    that contains whipworm eggs.
  Symptoms:
  - Heavy infections can cause painful, frequent bowel motions that are mixed with
    blood, water, and mucus.
  - Rectal prolapse, in which the rectum deforms and protrudes from the anus, is
    another potential scenario.
  trivia_1: Whipworm infection affects 604 to 795 million people worldwide.
  trivia_2: The roundworm Trichuris trichiura, also called the human whipworm, causes
    trichuriasis in people. The reason it is called the whipworm is that it resembles
    a whip and has big handles on the back end. The whipworm has a thick posterior
    anus and a tiny anterior esophagus.
  trivia_3: ' Ascaris, whipworm, and hookworm are examples of helminths that are
    spread by soil (parasitic worms). They collectively bear a significant portion
    of the global disease burden.'
