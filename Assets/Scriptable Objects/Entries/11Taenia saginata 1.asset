  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  Kingdom: Animal
  Phylum: Platyhelminthes
  Class: Cestoda
  Order: Cyclophyllidea
  Family: Taeniidae
  Genus: Taenia
  Species: Taenia saginata
  Characteristics: The tapeworm Taenia saginata belongs to the family Taeniidae,
    class Cestoidea, and order Cyclophyllidea.
  Symptoms:
  - Mild epigastric discomfort, nausea, flatulence, diarrhea, or hunger pangs are
    typical signs of taeniasis.
  trivia_1: The tapeworm species Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm), Taenia solium (pork
    tapeworm), and Taenia asiatica are responsible for the parasitic infection known
    as taeniasis in humans (Asian tapeworm). These tapeworms can spread to humans
    through the consumption of raw or undercooked pork (T. saginata) or beef (T.
    solium and T. asiatica).
  trivia_2: T. Saginata tapeworm is larger than the other two tapeworms (up to 10
    meters (m) in length) (usually 3 m). In addition to stomach trouble and abdominal
    pain, tapeworms can also result in appetite loss, weight loss, and other digestive
    issues. The active passage of proglottids (tapeworm segments) via the anus and
    in the feces is the most obvious symptom of taeniasis.
  trivia_3: These tapeworms can spread to humans through the consumption of raw or
    undercooked pork (T. saginata) or beef (T. solium and T. asiatica).
