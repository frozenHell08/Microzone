  Characteristics: Lassa fever signs and symptoms normally appear one to three weeks
    after the patient has come into contact with the virus. Approximately 80% of
    Lassa fever virus infections have minor symptoms and go undetected.
  Symptoms:
  - Lassa fever typically manifests gradually over time. Malaise, overall weakness,
    and fever are the first symptoms. A
  - A headache, sore throat, chest discomfort, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
    coughing, and stomach pain may develop a few days later.
  trivia_1: 'Lassa fever is an acute viral disease that is transmitted by the common
    African rat and is animal-borne, or zoonotic. '
  trivia_2: There are areas in West Africa where it is endemic, including Sierra
    Leone, Liberia, Guinea, and Nigeria. Due to the animal vector's widespread distribution
    in the region, neighboring nations are also at risk.
  trivia_3: The rubella virus causes the mild febrile rash sickness known as rubella.
    Droplets are used to spread it from person to person (the virus is present in
    throat secretions). It primarily, though not exclusively, affects youngsters,
    and when pregnant women are infected, it can lead to fetal deformity. The only
    source of infection is humans.
